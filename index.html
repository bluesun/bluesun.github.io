WEBSITE TEMPORARELY DISACTIVATED

As of Tuesday 28 February 2017 I realised that one page on my former website had been tampered with, replacing a blog entry with unknown garbage content.

To protect the visitors of my domain I did immediately deactivate my website in a first step.

The current page is the seed of my new website located on github pages to circumvent the vulnerability of a (properly updated and SSL-secured) Wordpress site.

For now please look at LinkedIn for my professional profile.
